# Game Off 2021

Game Off is an annual game jam, where participants spend the month of November creating games based on a secret theme. Participate individually, or as a team. Use whatever game engines, libraries, and languages you like. 

The theme for this year's Game Off is...



## BUG! 

Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to create a game between now and December 1 incorporating the theme somehow. After a few weeks of playing and rating the games by participants, the winners will be announced shortly thereafter.

As usual, you may interpret ‘BUG’ however you wish …
